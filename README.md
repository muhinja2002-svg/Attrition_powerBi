# üìâ HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard: Retain Your Talent

---

Stop guessing why your top talent is walking out the door. This project is a powerful, interactive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to transform raw HR data into actionable insights, helping you understand, predict, and ultimately reduce employee **attrition**.

Turnover is expensive. Data is your defense.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Insights

The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of attrition across the organization, allowing you to slice and dice the data to uncover hidden trends:

* **Attrition Drivers:** Quickly identify the variables most correlated with turnover, such as **Job Role**, **Monthly Income**, **Work-Life Balance**, or **Distance From Home**.
* **Trend Analysis:** Monitor attrition rates over time to see if recent changes or initiatives are having an impact.
* **Demographic Breakdown:** Analyze resignation patterns based on key employee attributes:
    * **Age Band**
    * **Gender**
    * **Education Field**
    * **Marital Status**
* **Department Performance:** Benchmark attrition rates between **Sales**, **R&D**, and other departments to pinpoint problem areas.
* **Interactive Filters:** Use slicers to drill down into specific segments, like "Ex-Employees who work **Over Time**" or "Staff in a specific **Job Level**."

## üöÄ Getting Started
